### Technical Requirements
* PostgreSQL
* ExpressJS
* Typescript
* Jest
* Prettier
* ESlint


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and get it running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

* Software for API Testing: Insomnia, Postman, ...
* PostgreSQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Change the values in .env following the keys of env.example
  ```sh
  ---DATABASE
  NODE_ENV = "development"

  DATABASE_URL = //PostgreSQL URL

  TOKEN_SECRET = 

  TOKEN_EXPIRES = 

  SENDGRID_API_KEY = 
  ```
  * Do the same for .env.test if you want to have a different database for testing
  
  
5. Run prisma migrations
   ```sh
   npm run prisma:run:migration
   ```
    * Run prisma migrations for the test database
   ```sh
   npm run migrate-dbtest
   ```
   
6. Import .json file into your software for API testing
    * It has been exported from Insomnia  
    * To convert the file into another format collection you can use: https://www.apimatic.io/transformer/


## For testing
